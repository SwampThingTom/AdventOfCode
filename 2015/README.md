# Advent of Code 2015

I'm using the 2015 Advent of Code puzzles to experiment with doing the puzzles in different languages.
It started as prep for doing the 2022 Advent of Code in a different language each day.
For day 8, I used it as a way to experiment with using Julia for 2024.

Day 1: BASIC\
Day 2: 6502 Assembly\
Day 3: Pascal\
Day 4: C\
Day 5: LISP\
Day 6: Smalltalk\
Day 7: Rexx\
Day 8: Julia
