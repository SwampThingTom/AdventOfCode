# Adapters with a delta of 3 from the previous adapter can never be removed so
# they are in every permutation. This means that we can divide the problem into
# finding the number of permutations for each sequence of consecutive deltas of 1,
# and then multiplying those together to find the total number of permutations.
#
# To do this, we will:
# 1. Transform the adapters into an array of deltas.
# 2. Split the result into a series of sequences of 1 or more 1's separated by 3's.
# 3. Determine the permutations for that sequence based on its length (the number of 1's it contains).
# 4. Return the product of the number of permutations in each sequence.
